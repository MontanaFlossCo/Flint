/// Focusing on one or more features results in only logging related to the focused items being produced,
/// automatically setting debug log level for those features and topic paths.

/// Topic Paths are used to allow control of non-Feature subsystems that have opted in to Contextual Logging.
/// Feature identifiers are converted to Topic Paths so we have one common concept for logging hierarchy.
