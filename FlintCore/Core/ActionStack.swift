/// An Action Stack is a trail of actions a user has performed from a specific Feature, with
/// sub-stacks created when the user then uses an action from another feature, so each stack
/// can represent a graph of actions broken down by feature.
///
/// Certain actions will "Close" their stack, e.g. a "Close" option on a document editing feature. Some stacks
/// may never be closed however, say a "DrawingFeature" that allows use of many drawing tools. There is no
/// clear end to that except closing the document, an operation on a different feature.
///
/// !!! TODO: Work out what this means for sub-stacks. We want to retain information about what was
/// done in other features, in amongst the current stack's features, but when the stack closes we
/// don't want to lose that history if there was not a "closing" action of the sub stack. Some sub-stacks
/// should be implicitly discarded however - e.g. drawing functions.
///
/// We need reference semantics here because we have parent relationships and navigate the graph.
///
/// !!! TODO: Use LIFOQueue to limit to the number of past items held to avoid blowing/leaking memory over time
