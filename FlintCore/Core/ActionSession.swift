/// An ActionSession is used to group a bunch of Action invocations, ensure they are invoked on the expected queue,
/// and track the Action Stacks that result from performing actions.
///
/// The session used for an action invocation is recorded in Flint timelines and logs to aid in debugging.
///
/// The default `ActionSession.main` session provided is what your UI will use most of the time. However if
/// your application supports multiple concurrent windows or documents you may wish to create more so that
/// you can see timeline and log events broken down per window or document, e.g. with the session name equal to the
/// document name or a symbolic equivalent of it for privacy. This way you can see what the user is doing in a multi-context environment.
///
/// Furthermore, if your application performs background tasks you should consider creation a session for these.
///
/// The lifetime of an ActionStack can be tracked in logging and analytics and tied to a specific activity session,
/// and is demarcated by the first use of an action from a feature, and the action that indicates termination of the current "feature".
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// A session can only be used from a single thread or queue, the queue set when creating the session. This is known as the
/// `callerQueue`.
///
/// Actions can select which queue they will be called to `perform` on, via their `queue` property. This is *always*
/// the queue they will execute on, and may be entirely different from the session's queue.
///
/// This mechanism guarantees that code calling into an `ActionSession` does not need to care about the queue an Action expects,
/// and Actions do not need to care about the queue they are called on, thus eliminating excessive thread hops (AKA "mmm, just DispatchQueue.async it").
/// This reduces "slushiness" and lag in UIs, and makes it easier to reason about the code.
///
/// The dispatcher will ensure that the Actions are called synchronously on their desired queue, even if that is the same as the current queue.
/// It will also make sure that they call their completion handler on the session's `callerQueue`, without excessive queue hops
/// so that if the caller is already on the correct thread, there is no async dispatch required.
