///
/// This will attempt to detect if the caller is on the queue the action expects, and avoid crashing with a `DispatchQueue.sync`
/// call when already on that queue. If the current queue is not the action's queue, it will use a `DispatchQueue.sync`.
///
/// The goal is that if the app is on the main queue, call `perform` and the dispatcher than finds the action expects
/// the `main` queue, that no queue or async thread hops occur. This prevents a "slushy" UI that is always updating
/// asynchronously, and means the caller does not have to worry about the queue they are on, and nor does the `Action`.
///
/// However, it is important to not that this mechanism (using setSpecific/getSpecific) will not currently work if the Action's
/// queue uses a `target` queue. Trivia: the `SmartDispatchQueue`
