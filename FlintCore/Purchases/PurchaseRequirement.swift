/// Use a `PurchaseRequirement` to express the rules about what purchased products enable your Feature(s).
///
/// You can express complex rules about how your Features are enabled using a graph of requirements.
/// Each Feature can only have one requirement when using the `.purchaseRequired` availability value,
/// but one requirement can match one or all of a list of product IDs, as well as having dependencies on other requirements.
///
/// With this you can express the following kinds of rules:
///
/// * Feature X is available if Product A is purchased
/// * Feature X is available if Product A OR Product B OR Product C is purchased
/// * Feature X is available if Product A AND Product B AND Product C is purchased
/// * Feature X is available if Product A AND (Product B OR Product C) is purchased
/// * Feature X is available if (Product A OR Product B) AND ((Product B OR Product C) AND PRODUCT D) is purchased
/// * Feature X is available if (Product A OR Product B) AND ((Product B OR Product C) AND PRODUCT D AND PRODUCT E) is purchased
///
/// ...and so on. This allows you to map Feature availability to a range of different product pricing strategies and relationships,
/// such as "Basic" level of subscription plus a "Founder" IAP that maybe offered to unlock all features in future for a one-off purchase,
/// provided they still have a basic subscription.
