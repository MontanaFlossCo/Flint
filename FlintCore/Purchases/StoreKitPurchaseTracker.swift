/// A basic StoreKit In-App Purchase checker that uses only the payment queue and *local storage*
/// to cache the list of purchase statuses. *It does not validate receipts*.
///
/// The local storage is unprotected if the user unlocks the device, and as such may be
/// subject to relatively easy editing by the determined cheapskate user to unlock features.
///
/// - note: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Do not use this implementation if you insist on cryprographically verifying
/// purchases.
/// - note: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ It is our view that we should rely on the security of Apple's platform and not
/// be overly concerned with users performing hacks and workarounds. People that go to the effort of
/// jailbreaking, re-signing apps or applying other patching or data editing mechanisms
/// are unlikely to have paid you any money anyway.
///
/// If this isn't good enough for you, you will need to add your own app-specific logic to verify this so there isn't a
/// single point of verification, and to check receipts. You may not want to use Flint
/// for purchase verification at all if it transpires that the Swift call sites for
/// conditional requests are easily circumvented.
///
/// - note: In-App Purchases APIs are not available on watchOS as of watchOS 5. Any
/// Feature that requires a purchase will not be enabled on watchOS.
