///
/// Flint Routes support multiple custom app URL schemes and multiple associated domains for deep linking.
///
/// A LinkCreator will only create links for one app scheme or domain - typically apps do not need to generate different
/// kinds of URLs for the same app, but you may need to handle multiple legacy URLs or domains.
///
/// As such, Flint will create a default link creator for the first App URL scheme and Associated Domain that you define
/// in your Info.plist (for app URLs) and the domain you pass when calling `Flint.quickSetup`.
///
/// This will be used for the automatic link creation for Activities and other system integrations. You can
/// change this behaviour by creating a new `LinkCreator` for the scheme and domain you prefer, and assign it to
/// `Flink.linkCreator`.
///
/// You can create your own instances to produce links with specific schemes and domains. Links can only be created
/// for actions that have routes defined in your Feature's `urlMappings`.
