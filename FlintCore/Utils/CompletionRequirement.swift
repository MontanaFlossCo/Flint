import Foundation

/// A type that handles completion callbacks with safety checks and semantics
/// that reduce the risks of callers forgetting to call the completion handler.
///
/// The type is not concurrency safe (see notes in Threading) and it will always call the `completion` handler
/// synchronously, using the supplied `completionQueue` if available, or on whatever the current queue thread is if
/// `currentQueue` is nil.
///
/// To use, define a typealias for this type, with T the type of the completion function's argument (use a tuple if
/// your completion requires multiple arguments).
///
/// Then make your function that requires a completion handler take an instance of this type instead of the closure type, and make
/// the function expect a return value of the nested `Status` type:
///
/// ```
/// protocol MyCoordinator {
///   typealias DoSomethingCompletion = CompletionRequirement<Bool>
///
///   func doSomething(input: Any, completionRequirement: DoSomethingCompletion) -> DoSomethingCompletion.Status
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now, when calling this function on the protocol, you construct the requirement instance, pass it and verify the result:
///
/// ```
/// let coordinator: MyCoordinator = ...
/// let completion = MyCoordinator.DoSomethingCompletion( { (shouldCancel: Bool, completedAsync: Bool) in
///    print("Cancel? \(shouldCancel)")
/// })
///
/// The block takes one argument of type `T`, in this case a boolean, and a second `Bool` argument that indicates
/// if the completion block has been called asynchronously.
///
/// // Call the function that requires completion
/// let status = coordinator.doSomething(input: x, completionRequirement: completion)
///
/// // Make sure one of the valid statuses was returned.
/// // This safety test ensures that the completion from the correct completion requirement instance was returned.
/// precondition(completion.verify(status))
///
/// // If the result does not return true for `isCompletingAsync`, the completion callback will have already been called by now.
/// if !status.isCompletingAsync {
///     print("Completed synchronously: \(status.value)")
/// } else {
///     print("Completing asynchronously... see you later")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When implementing such a function requiring a completion handler, you return one of two statuses returned by either
/// the `CompletionRequirement.completed(_ arg: T)` or `CompletionRequirement.willCompleteAsync()`.
/// The `CompletionRequirement` will take care of calling the completion block as appropriate.
///
/// ```
/// func doSomething(input: Any, completionRequirement: DoSomethingCompletion) -> DoSomethingCompletion.Status {
///     return completionRequirement.completedSync(false)
/// }
///
/// // or for async completion, you retain the result and later call `completed(value)`
///
/// func doSomething(input: Any, completionRequirement: DoSomethingCompletion) -> DoSomethingCompletion.Status {
///     // Capture the async status
///     let result = completionRequirement.willCompleteAsync()
///     DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 5) {
///         // Use the retained status to indicate completion later
///         result.completed(false)
///     }
///     return result
/// }
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// A `CompletionRequirement` is not concurrency safe. You must not change any properties or call any methods
/// after calling `completedSync` or `willCompleteAsync`. State of the object will not change asynchronously once
/// you have called either of these.
