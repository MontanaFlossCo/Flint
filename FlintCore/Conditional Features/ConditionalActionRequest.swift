/// a `perform()` using a `ConditionalActionBinding`.

/// The protocol extensions on `ConditionalFeature` only supports
/// `request` and not `perform`, forcing the caller to test if the feature is available first and at least
/// explicitly ignore the "feature not available" path, but hopefully provide a code path for that.
