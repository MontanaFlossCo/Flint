/// Actions are statically defined to avoid the mistake of storing state with them. Any state belongs in
/// the `input` passed when performing the action.
///
/// Many of these static properties have default implementations provided by a protocol extension.
///
/// - note: Action implementations *must* be final due to Swift extension requirements.
///
/// The same action can be reused in different features, so they receive all context they need when executing.
///
/// Note that actions have their own analytics ID defined statically.

    /// - note: Due to a Swift compiler issue, you cannot declare this as an optional type. As a result, all invocations
