/// Actions are statically defined to avoid the mistake of storing state with them. Any state belongs in

/// Many of these static properties have default implementations provided by a protocol extension.
///
/// - note: Action implementations *must* be final due to Swift extension requirements.
///
/// The same action can be reused in different features, so they receive all context they need when executing.

/// Note that actions have their own analytics ID defined statically.
