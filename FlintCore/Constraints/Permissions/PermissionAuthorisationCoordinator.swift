/// in to the permission authorisation controller flow.
///
/// Apps can use this interface to present custom UI before the authorisation flow starts,
/// and update this before and after each permission is requested, with control over what happens next.
///
/// For example you may have non-modal UI that shows the user what the camera will be used for,
/// and it contains a SKIP button. If they tap this, you call the completion handler passing `.skip` and the
/// controller will move on to the next permission, or finish the flow if there are no more permissions required.

    /// if they press "OK". If there is a cancel or "X" close button, you would call `completion(.cancelAll)` to terminate
    /// the flow immediately.
